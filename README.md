This project contains three word games broadcast through a user interface. 

The initial games included are Anagrams, Wordle, and Pangrams. Each game can be played under a multitude of word lengths and
time control options. Additionally, all games support keyboard input as well as manual pressing the UI buttons.

The project can be run by downloading the java files or by running the .jar.
